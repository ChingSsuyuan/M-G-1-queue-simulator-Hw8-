"""
Simulation of an M|G|1 queue with one class
Uses simpy to dynamically generate events 

The simulator uses the Gamma distribution for service times, 
with a hardcoded exception for the deterministic distribution for second moment
1/MU^2. This has advantage of seeing how changing the service distribution 
changes the results. In addition, Gamma distribution with SHAPE = 1 (or K=2) 
corresponds to the Exponential distribution
